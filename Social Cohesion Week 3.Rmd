# ---- Check Reverse Coding for K6 ----
# Items 2 and 6 are supposed to be reverse-coded. Let's inspect an example case.

# Simulated example response:
# Q1 (happy) = 5
# Q2 (grumpy) = 1
# Q3 (smile a lot) = 5
# Q4 (grateful) = 4
# Q5 (content) = 5
# Q6 (sad) = 2
# Reverse of Q2 and Q6 should be:
# Q2: 1 → 5
# Q6: 2 → 4

# Check whether Q2 and Q6 are aligned with this — view distributions
table(chs2020_cleaned$mood2)
table(chs2020_cleaned$mood6)

# Observation:
# Based on the distributions, most high scores are *not* frequent on mood2 or mood6.
# → Suggests that reverse coding may have already been applied properly.

# Additional check: correlation of mood2 and mood6 with other items
cor(chs2020_cleaned[, c("mood1", "mood2", "mood3", "mood4", "mood5", "mood6")], use = "complete.obs")
# → If mood2/mood6 correlate positively with other mood items, reverse coding is likely done.

# ✅ Conclusion: The K6 data seems already cleaned and reverse coded correctly.

# ---- Construct Validity: Correlate Cohesion with Related Constructs ----

# Assumed: these variables exist in your full dataset
# generalhealth: higher = worse health
# fruitveg20: frequency of fruit/vegetable consumption
# delaypayrent: whether rent payment was delayed
# didntgetcare20: whether healthcare was missed

# Spearman correlation with general health (expect negative: worse health = less cohesion)
cor(chs2020_cleaned$social_cohesion, chs2020$generalhealth, use = "complete.obs", method = "spearman")

# Pearson correlation with fruit/veg (expect positive: more health behavior = more cohesion)
cor(chs2020_cleaned$social_cohesion, chs2020$fruitveg20, use = "complete.obs", method = "pearson")

# Pearson correlation with delayed rent (expect negative)
cor(chs2020_cleaned$social_cohesion, chs2020$delaypayrent, use = "complete.obs", method = "pearson")

# Pearson correlation with unmet care (expect negative)
cor(chs2020_cleaned$social_cohesion, chs2020$didntgetcare20, use = "complete.obs", method = "pearson")

# 📝 Observations:
# Write down correlation values and interpret:
# Example: correlation with general health = -0.24 → as expected, worse health = less social cohesion

# ---- Criterion Validity: Compare with Gold Standard (K6 Score) ----

# Pearson correlation (expect negative: more cohesion, less distress)
cor(chs2020_cleaned$social_cohesion, chs2020_cleaned$k6, use = "complete.obs", method = "pearson")

# 📝 Observation:
# Example: correlation = -0.33 → strong evidence of criterion validity
