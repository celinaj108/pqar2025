# Week 2 Analysis

# Internal Consistency (Cronbach's Alpha):
## Considering content validity, we decided that helpneighbors20_q1 that asks--
## People in your neighborhood are  willing to help their neighbors. Would you sayâ€¦--
## is important as intuitively this is the most straightforward question related
## to neighborhood social cohesion. 


# Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA):
## The loadings for all five items of the social cohesion scale were all above 0.3
## helpneighbors20_q1 (0.631) discussissues (0.588) helpcommproj (0.483) trustkeys (0.47) proudneigh (0.472)
## when conducted a factor analysis with one latent factor.


# Compare Scale Performance by Age Group:
## The average social cohesion scores by age band were 18-44 (2.42) 45-64 (2.196) 65+ (2.119).
## It seemed like the social cohesion score decreased as age increased. Additional ANOVA analysis
## revealed that the difference of the mean social cohesion score between age group was significant (p=2.2e-16)
## Still, the effect size (SSE_ageband/SSE_total) was 0.034; it means that only 3.4% of the variation in
## social cohesion is explained by age band.
